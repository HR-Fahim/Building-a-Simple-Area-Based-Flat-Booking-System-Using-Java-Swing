# About 
A demo Management System for booking flats based on the area has been made here. There have been used `Java Swing` & also `Java` for coding. The main purpose of making it was to describe how a simple Management System can be built using only `java` & `Java Swing`.<br/>

<sub> ****P.S.*** It was a part of project from CSE215 course offered by CSE, NSU (North South University).*<sub/>
# Program Features
In this program, one can sign up to create a personal account and also log in using that information. After the login step, one can choose his/her preferred area. Next, he/she can choose his/her desired flat (one can choose one flat at a time) and book it by confirming it. The booked flat can not book someone else again. The program gets flat data from internal hardware located file named `common.txt` & `common1.txt` file and uses the `user.txt` file to store user information.
# Requirements
- [JDK 14.0.1](https://www.malavida.com/en/soft/java-jdk/)
- [Eclipse Version 2020](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/7143-eclipse-ide.html) (Recommended)
# Installation
- Extract `Java Project.rar` & put the folder into `C:\` drive.
- Open the `Flat_Booking_Management` folder using a Java Compiler. Then, run that `Login.java` file from the folder (this will open the `Login` window).
- Next, just follow the opened window commands that it!
# Caution
There are some instructions to follow:
- Do not remove any files from the `Java Project` folder.
- Do not delete the `Java Project` folder from `C:\` drive.
- Do not remove `null null` from `user.txt`.
# Resetting
- If want to reset the program then just remove everything from the `user.txt` file except the `null null` and put the cursor at the next line and save it.
- Remove everything from that `common.txt` file and enter again `FLT1` to `10` in the column. Also, do the same to the `common1.txt` file and enter `FLT1.1` to `10.1` in the column again.
# Common Bug
After filling up with the correct username & password in the Login window, if it shows the `Warning` window again & again; simply reset the `user.txt` file and set the cursor at the next line, also reset the other `.txt` files as well if you want.
